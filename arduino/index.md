Welcome ðŸ‘‹ to the second module in your Physical Computing journey: **Introduction to Microcontrollers** (using Arduino). Here, you will learn about [digital output](./led-blink.md), [analog output](./led-fade.md), [digital input](./buttons.md), and [analog input](./potentiometers.md) and build interesting musical instruments along the way from a [button piano](./piano.md) to a [Jedi-force instrument](./force-sensitive-resistors.md#jedi-force-instrument)! Get started with our first lesson: [L1: Turning on an LED](./led-on.md) and start building! âš’ðŸ› 

{: .note }
Although you can begin your learning journey here, we  recommend that you complete the first module on [Intro to Electronics](../electronics/index.md) first. This will allow you to have a more deep understanding of the content in this section, and we will occassionally refer back to [Intro to Electronics](../electronics/index.md).

<!-- Call this intro to Microcontrollers and then cast Arduino as an example? -->

<!-- Add an Intro to Microcontrollers, talk about Arduino vs. RaspPi -->

## Why this Tutorial Series?

There are many Arduino resources online, many good, some bad. Our two favorites are, perhaps, [Adafruitâ€™s 18-Step Guide](https://learn.adafruit.com/series/learn-arduino) and Jeremy Blum's [Exploring Arduino: Tools and Techniques for Engineering Wizardry](https://alliance-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/permalink/f/kjtuig/CP51311244450001451), 2nd Edition, Wiley, 2020. See our [Resources](../resources/index.md) page for more.

Our lessons are different both in approach and scope. They are based on years of experience in teaching physical computingâ€”to design students, computer scientists, and engineers at the undergraduate and graduate levelâ€”and we attempt to address common confusions head-on.

Thus, while other resources **start** with digital/analog input (or quickly intermix input and output), we've found that it's easier to start with **output**. For novices, input is simply harderâ€”it requires an understanding (or at least an awareness) of concepts like pull-down resistors, voltage dividers, and that a microcontroller reads *voltages* rather than current or resistance.

So, our lessons start and stick with **output** to solidify understanding of how to programmatically control microcontroller pins before adding in **input**â€”where the fun, of course, really starts! Moreover, most resourcesâ€”at least those we are aware ofâ€”strike a different balance between depth and breadth. We love Adafruit's [tutorials](http://learn.adafruit.com/) but they tend towards step-by-step construction recipes rather than explaining *why* or *how* things work. As a college-level resource, we attempt to provide a deeper understanding at a cost of complexity and longer lessons. But we think it's worth it.

<!-- The [Adafruit lessons](https://learn.adafruit.com/series/learn-arduino) provide a rapid, broad taste of using microcontrollers for digital and analog I/O. As a book, Blum's [Exploring Arduino](https://alliance-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/permalink/f/kjtuig/CP51311244450001451) goes deeper; however, ne -->

## Arduino Uno R3 vs. Arduino Leonardo

For this introductory lesson series, we use two of the most popular 5V Arduino models: the [Arduino Uno Rev3](https://store.arduino.cc/products/arduino-uno-rev3) and the [Arduino Leonardo](https://store-usa.arduino.cc/products/arduino-leonardo-with-headers); however, the lessons themselves should translate to almost any Arduino boardâ€”which is the beauty of the Arduino hardware-software ecosystem!.

![Image showing both the Arduino Uno and the Arduino Leonardo[]({{ "/assets/images/ArduinoUnoVsArduinoLeonardo.png" | relative_url }})

Both the [Uno](https://store.arduino.cc/products/arduino-uno-rev3) and [Leonardo](https://store-usa.arduino.cc/products/arduino-leonardo-with-headers) have similar form factors, memory, clock speeds (16MHz), and GPIO pins (20 digital I/O pins); however, there are some differences:

* The **Uno** uses the [**ATmega328P** microcontroller](http://ww1.microchip.com/downloads/en/DeviceDoc/Atmel-7810-Automotive-Microcontrollers-ATmega328P_Datasheet.pdf) while the **Leonardo** uses the [**ATmega32u4**](http://www.atmel.com/devices/atmega32u4.aspx)

* The Leonardo's **ATmega32u4** has **built-in USB support** whereas the Uno actually has a second microcontroller (the ATmega16U2) to provide USB communication. On the Uno, pins 0 and 1 are used to communicate with the 16u2 co-processor, which can conflict with components plugged into those pins (so our examples will often avoid using pins 0 or 1, even on the Leonardo)

* Because the **Leonardo** natively supports USB, it can be mounted as a **Human-Input Device** and thus used as a mouse, keyboard, or joystick.

* The **Leonardo** has **12 analog inputs** vs. the **Uno's 6**

In the lessons themselves, we'll mark specific differences between the Uno and Leonardo, when relevant.

Now, let the fun begin! ðŸš€ðŸ¥³

## Intro to Output
The following tutorials are interactive and designed to be completed **in order**. All Arduino code is open source and in this [GitHub repository](https://github.com/makeabilitylab/arduino).

<!-- TODO:

    * [Done] Consider adding a debugging with Serial Monitor lesson -- maybe after Lesson 3? Update: I put it after Lesson 2
    * I'm tempted to put in a tone lesson after LED fading because we are just too LED heavy here imo.
        - Putting it after LED fading (analogWrite) let's us bring up difference between changing PWM duty cycle (with analogWrite) and changing square wave freq (with tone)
        - Could demonstrate the above by hooking up a potentiometer that changes the PWM wave using a pot; then switch to changing freq with pot
        - Could also demonstrate by hooking up piezo two one pin that is 490 for PWM and another that is 980Hz
        - Some great ideas in our https://makeabilitylab.github.io/physcomp/esp32/tone.html lesson too

### [Lesson 1: Turning on an LED](led-on.md)

Introduces the Arduino power and ground pins, powering an initial LED circuit with a current limiting resistor, and plugging components into the Arduino.

### [Lesson 2: Blinking an LED](led-blink.md)

Introduces the Arduino IDE, digital output, and the ability to programmatically control Arduino GPIO pins to turn an LED on and off via [`digitalWrite`](https://www.arduino.cc/reference/en/language/functions/digital-io/digitalwrite/).

### [Lesson 3: Serial debugging](serial-print.md)

Introduces some basic debugging approaches for Arduino, with a specific focus on [`Serial.print`](https://www.arduino.cc/reference/en/language/functions/communication/serial/print/).

### [Lesson 4: Fading an LED](led-fade.md)

Introduces analog output, pulse-width modulation (PWM), and demonstrates how to gradually fade an LED on and off by using [`analogWrite`](https://www.arduino.cc/reference/en/language/functions/analog-io/analogwrite/)

### [Lesson 5: Blinking an LED Part 2](led-blink2.md)

Introduces the concept of using Arduino GPIO pins as either current **sources** or **sinks** by hooking up two LED circuit configurations: one circuit with the LED cathode towards GND and another with the LED anode towards GND.

### [Lesson 6: RGB LEDs](rgb-led.md)

Introduces RGB LEDs, using both common anode and cathode versions, and independently controlling brightness and hue.

### [Lesson 7: Crossfading RGB LEDs](rgb-led-fade.md)

Shows how to fade between RGB colors using [`analogWrite`](https://www.arduino.cc/reference/en/language/functions/analog-io/analogwrite/), to use the [HSL colorspace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HSL_and_HSV) to more easily (and independently) control hue and brightness, and to use and load local `C/C++` libraries

### [Lesson 8: Rate Blinking Multiple LEDs](led-blink3.md)

In this lesson, we will learn how to blink multiple LEDs at different rates and build our first [C/C++ class](http://www.cplusplus.com/doc/tutorial/classes/), which will greatly simplify our code and, as an added bonus, reduce its size by eliminating code redundancy.

## Intro to Input

### [Lesson 1: Using buttons](buttons.md)

Introduces buttons (aka momentary switches), digital input, using Arduino's [`digitalRead`](https://www.arduino.cc/reference/en/language/functions/digital-io/digitalread/) function, and pull-up and pull-down resistors.

### [Lesson 2: Button piano](piano.md)

In [this lesson](piano.md), we are going to make a simple five-key piano with tactile buttons wired with internal pull-up resistors and a [piezo buzzer](https://www.adafruit.com/product/160).

### [Lesson 3: Debouncing switches](debouncing.md)

In [this lesson](debouncing.md), we'll learn about "contact bouncing" and how to "debounce" to make our digital input more reliable.

### [Lesson 4: Potentiometers](potentiometers.md)

[This lesson](potentiometers.md) introduces potentiometers and rheostats, analog input, and using Arduino's [`analogRead`](https://www.arduino.cc/reference/en/language/functions/analog-io/analogread/) function. Also shows how to use Tinkercad to prototype and test circuits in an online simulator and how to use a multimeter to measure current.

### [Lesson 5: Force-sensitive resistors](force-sensitive-resistors.md)

Introduces [force-sensitive resistors (FSRs)](force-sensitive-resistors.md), how to use two-legged variable resistors with microcontrollers (including FSRs), and how to make a force-piano. Very Jedi-like!
